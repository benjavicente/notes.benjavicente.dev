## Notes ideas

- The importance of batching
  - stop repeating stuff with n queries to the backend
  - graphql + dataloader, trpc, single flight mutations
- The key parts of Routers.
  - `loaders` are really `beforeNavigation`
  - how it combos with batching
- Query and Mutation client (ReactQuery)
  - Caching is different from data loading
  - Key to integrate data loading with library primitives
- There will always be new UI libraries (why base-ui makes sense, and leaving baggage behind)
  - New CSS and JS features -> more baggage
  - Open source projects need incentives, not only community
- Client vs backend first, isomorphic apps coming from SPA, and going back to the server with RSC.
