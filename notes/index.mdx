## This is not a blog

[Here is my blog](//benjavicente.dev/blog).
I have a lot of ideas that don't deserve a full blog post, but still want to share.
Here are some of them.

The difference is a blog entry vs a post entry is similar to a video vs a short. 
Notes are simple ideas that can be consumed in a couple of minutes, while blog posts are more detailed and produced.


## Why astro

I don't like that much [Astro](https://astro.build).
I don't like too much their templating syntax and that it doesn't provide a client side router.
But because it's simpler thanks to content collections and been builded on vite, it made more cense to this stuff.
