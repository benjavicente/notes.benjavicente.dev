title: "Routers are frontend frameworks"

An programming application framework determines the structure that the code should follow,
such that the framework itself can provide abstractions that avoid repetition, allow easier optimizations, and provide a consistent developer experience.

A frontend framework isn't a component building library like React.
It isn't a build tool like Vite, or a state management solution.
Those can be combined to improve the DX, but I don't thing they convey the essence of a frontend framework.

Frontend frameworks are the ones responsable of separating the concerns of the application.
The concerns are usually grouped on URLs. So it's explicit that routing is part of the equation of what a frontend framework is.

There's also an implicit factor. Pages and data loading can be organized easily with code abstractions and conventions,
such that a router can orchestrate how those pieces work on the entire application.

## Why routers are needed

The web started as a document sharing platform. HTML are documents.
Browsers behave like document viewers, even thought they allow app-like interactions.
And it works. But doesn't work great when simple systems try to be more like apps.

Applications hold state, both in UI and data.
When the state changes, like on navigation, it shouldn't restart from scratch.
But that is how the browser works.

This behavior does not scale.
Apps will tend to have more code that should not be re-executed on navigation.
Both on the server, like avoiding to reload the entire data for a page, and on the client, like reloading global libraries (ej: analytics) and state.

[Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/), [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/how-it-works), [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and a lot more, do eventually the same thing: 
Provide abstractions and constrains to avoid unnecessary reloading.

While the “frontend frameworks” term is usually associated with “the client side code”, it's more than that.
Routing are a key component on the server-client architecture,
and allows the code to scale both on organization and performance.
